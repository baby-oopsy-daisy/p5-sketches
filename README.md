All my p5.js sketches goes here

Note : If working with api's which allow only HTTP request
       ADD : "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/"
          before the api HTTP url to be able to use it in github gh-pages hosting
          (as hosting gh-pages only allows HTTPS request if a custom domain is not set i.e if              
          you are using the default github provided domain)
